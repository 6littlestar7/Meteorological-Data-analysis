## Hypothesis for this project: <a name="obj"></a>
The Hypothesis means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month say April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not. This monthly analysis has to be done for all 12 months over the 10 year period. So you are basically resampling your data from hourly to monthly, then comparing the same month over the 10 year period. 


## Installation of libraries <a name="installation"></a>
The following required libraries need to be installed. We can install these packages via conda or pip.

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- jupyterthemes


## Dataset Attributes and Info: <a name="di"></a>


* Total Number of Data Point: 96453
* Total Number of Attribute/Columns in data set is 11.


### Dataset attributes:

* Formatted Date
* Summary
* Precip Type
* Temperature (C)
* Apparent Temperature (C)
* Humidity
* Wind Speed (km/h)
* Wind Bearing (degrees)
* Visibility (km)
* Pressure (millibars)
* Daily Summary

## Conclusion: <a name="results"></a>
As there many ups and downs in the Apparant Tempreture in the above images for different months over the 10 year period. So , We can conclude that global warming has caused a major difference and unreliability in temperature while the average humidity has remained constant throughout the 10 years.
